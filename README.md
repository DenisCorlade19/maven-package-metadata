# maven-package-metadata
A package that, given a list of effective POM files, parses them and returns a JSON file containing the package, its versions, the timestamp and also its dependencies

## How to use:
It is as simple as :
```
go run main.go
```

The application requires a folder of effective POM files as input. Effective POM files are generated by using the following maven commands: 
```
mvn -Dartifact="groupID:artifactID:version" dependency:get 
cp "name".pom pom.xml
mvn help:effective-pom -Doutput=effective-pom.xml
```
Two scripts splitting the above maven command have been created to automate the process and can be found in
the ```main.py``` file. The user needs a Linux based distribution in order to run the scripts.
